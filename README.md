<h1> Machine Learning Program Assignment</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a MASSEY Machine simulator written in C++. It is based on a simulated machine code system created by Massey University. The simulator reads and executes 16-bit machine code instructions from a file, mimicking the behavior of a simple CPU. Each instruction consists of an opcode and operands, enabling basic arithmetic, logical operations, memory manipulation, and program control.




<h2>Features</h2>
<b>           
- Reads MASSEY machine code from a file
- Decodes and executes 16-bit instructions
- Simulates a register-based CPU architecture
- Supports register operations, memory storage, arithmetic, logical operations, and branching
- Displays program execution step-by-step
</b>

<h2> Supported Instructions</h2>
<b>
- Load/store registers and memory
- Integer addition, negation, bit shifts
- Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR)
- Conditional jumps
- Halt instruction for program termination
</b>
