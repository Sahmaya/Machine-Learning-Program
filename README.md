<h1> Machine Learning Program Assignment</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a MASSEY Machine simulator written in C++. It is based on a simulated machine code system created by Massey University. The simulator reads and executes 16-bit machine code instructions from a file, mimicking the behavior of a simple CPU. Each instruction consists of an opcode and operands, enabling basic arithmetic, logical operations, memory manipulation, and program control.




<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>   
<li><b> Reads MASSEY machine code from a file </b></li>
<li><b> Decodes and executes 16-bit instructions</b></li>
<li><b> Simulates a register-based CPU architecture</b></li>
<li><b> Supports register operations, memory storage, arithmetic, logical operations, and branching</b></li>
<li><b> Displays program execution step-by-step</b></li>


<h2>Supported Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Load/store registers and memory</b></li>
    <li><b>Integer addition, negation, bit shifts</b></li>
    <li><b>Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR)</b></li>
    <li><b>Conditional jumps</b></li>
    <li><b>Halt instruction for program termination</b></li>
</ul>
